# Roadmap: geometric topology and the solved Kirby-list problems

Rob Kirby's problem list (`[Kir97]`, *Problems in Low-Dimensional Topology*) and its
successors hold many problems since **solved** (sometimes by proving the negation of
Kirby's question). Walking that list while building the
[`leanprover/lean-eval`](https://github.com/leanprover/lean-eval) topology problems raises a
narrower question than "can we prove this": can we even *state* the resolved theorem in Lean
today? For a good fraction the answer is no, not because the proof is hard but because the
*statement* needs primitives Mathlib lacks: Dehn surgery, knot concordance, hyperbolic
volume, Heegaard genus, foliation Euler classes, locally flat embeddings,
diffeomorphism-group topologies. This roadmap builds, on top of Mathlib, what is needed to
*state* (not prove) these theorems faithfully.

This is about **statements**, not proofs. A faithful statement of "the Weeks manifold has
the smallest volume among closed orientable hyperbolic 3-manifolds" is already a large,
valuable target. Many of the layers (the manifold buildout, gluing, surgery, the
diffeomorphism-group topology) are reusable infrastructure whose value does not depend on
any one Kirby problem.

Suggested homes: `TauCeti/Geometry/Manifold/` (gluing, connected sum, tubular
neighbourhoods, structure groups), `TauCeti/Geometry/Diffeomorphism/` (the C^∞ topology),
`TauCeti/LowDimTopology/` (Dehn surgery, Heegaard splittings, foliations),
`TauCeti/Geometry/Hyperbolic/` (constant-curvature structures and volume),
`TauCeti/Topology/PL/` (triangulations, collapse).

## Relationship to the Heegaard Floer roadmaps

This roadmap **owns knot theory done properly** (layer 4) and the **concordance and
cobordism foundations** (layer 6): the presentations of a knot or link as first-class types
and the maps between them, smoothly and topologically slice, the knot polynomials with their
algorithms, the concordance group, and the cobordism category. These are foundational
geometric topology that Dehn surgery, concordance, and grid homology all build on, so they
live here rather than inside any one homology theory.

The [combinatorial Heegaard Floer roadmap](../CombinatorialHeegaardFloer/README.md)
*consumes* these knot types and *contributes* homological invariants of them: it builds the
concordance invariant `τ` and the slice-genus bound `|τ(K)| ≤ g_s(K)`, and its Lane K
reconciles grid diagrams with the presentations built here (Cromwell's theorem). So the
dependency runs there-to-here for the *definitions* and here-to-there for the *invariants*.
The shared convention is "a knot has no privileged representation".

## Principles

- **Connected all the way down to Mathlib.** Every layer starts where Mathlib leaves off,
  with no floating definitions: where a primitive exists (`ModelWithCorners`, the tangent
  bundle, `IsCoveringMap`, `HomotopyGroup`, singular homology, the nascent Riemannian-metric
  library) we consume it, named in the inventories below; otherwise the roadmap adds it as an
  explicit dependency. The deliverable is a dependency graph rooted in current Mathlib, not a
  wishlist.
- **Maximum generality where it is natural.** Build manifolds-with-boundary, gluing, tubular
  neighbourhoods, and surgery in general dimension, with arbitrary structure groups (Top, PL,
  Diff, `O(n)`, `SO(n)`) rather than the smooth orthogonal case, and diffeomorphism-group
  topologies for general manifolds rather than just `S³`; the low-dimensional statements then
  fall out as instances. It is the difference between a library and a pile of special cases.
- **Treat the foundations as first-class goals.** Much of the gap is just missing
  differential and geometric topology, so "build connected sums" or "build Dehn surgery" are
  library goals that happen to unlock several problems, not one-off scaffolding.
- **Statements stay unbundled.** As in the PDE and Heegaard Floer roadmaps, named hypotheses
  (locally flat vs smooth, Top vs PL vs Diff, orientable vs not) stay separate rather than
  bundled, so a theorem can be restated in a neighbouring category without rebuilding the
  topology.

## Encoding conventions

These are the cross-cutting Lean choices that have to agree across layers, so that two
agents implementing different layers build compatible APIs rather than locally plausible but
mutually unusable ones. The per-layer sections pin the rest; this section fixes the spine.

- **A manifold is a type with instances, not a bundled record.** A manifold is a type `M`
  carrying the standard Mathlib instances (`TopologicalSpace M`, `ChartedSpace H M`,
  `IsManifold I n M`), exactly as Mathlib does it; constructions (gluing, connected sum,
  surgery, fillings) *produce* such a type together with its instances, and are related to
  one another up to `≃ₘ` / `≃ₜ` in theorem statements rather than by a quotient type. Build a
  moduli/quotient object only where a specific target genuinely needs "the set of manifolds
  up to diffeomorphism"; default to "a type plus a diffeomorphism in the statement".
- **Named conditions are predicates or hypotheses, not new structures.** "Closed",
  "orientable", "hyperbolic", "prime" and the like are predicates/typeclasses on a manifold;
  aliases such as `ClosedOrientable3Manifold` are abbreviations for "a manifold with these
  hypotheses", kept unbundled per the principle above. Carry orientation, framing, and other
  *data* (as opposed to mere properties) as explicit arguments with forgetful maps, not baked
  into the carrier.
- **Knots have no privileged type; do not define `Knot`.** There is no canonical
  representation, so the roadmap does not introduce a `Knot` type. The presentations of
  layer 4 are first-class types in their own right, and the geometric presentation is simply
  *a smooth embedding `S¹ ↪ M`* (worked over a general manifold `M` wherever possible, and
  specialised to `M = ℝ³` or `S³`). In the illustrative target signatures, `K` names a chosen
  presentation, by default a smooth embedding `S¹ ↪ S³`; an invariant or relation is stated on
  whichever presentation is most natural and transported across presentations by layer 4's
  correspondences. Where two layers must talk about "the same knot", they share a presentation
  type, not a hub type.
- **Isotopy is defined generally, then specialised.** Define isotopy and ambient isotopy for
  arbitrary (continuous, and smooth) maps between manifolds once, in full generality, and
  obtain knot equivalence as the specialisation to smooth embeddings `S¹ ↪ M`. The same
  general `Isotopic` underlies locally flat isotopy (layer 2), diffeotopies (layer 3), and
  concordance (layer 6); none of those should re-define it.

## Inventory: what Mathlib gives us (consume)

Verified against the pinned Mathlib (`Mathlib/`, commit `9caeba1`, Lean `v4.31.0-rc1`).

  `IsEmbedding`, `IsOpenEmbedding`, `IsClosedEmbedding` in `Mathlib/Topology/Maps/Basic.lean`.
- **Spheres.** The analytic manifold and Lie-group structure on `Metric.sphere` (via
  stereographic projection, and the circle as a Lie group) in
  `Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/Instances/Sphere.lean`.
- **Algebraic topology.** `FundamentalGroup` and `FundamentalGroupoid` in
  `Mathlib/AlgebraicTopology/FundamentalGroupoid/`; higher homotopy groups
  (`HomotopyGroup`) in `Mathlib/Topology/Homotopy/HomotopyGroup.lean`; covering maps

- **Riemannian metrics.** `RiemannianBundle`, `IsRiemannianManifold`, the induced
  `riemannianEDist`, and `EMetricSpace.ofRiemannianMetric` in
  `Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/Riemannian/Basic.lean`; path length in
  `Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/Riemannian/PathELength.lean`. This is the engine for layer 7,
  but it stops at the metric-and-distance level: no volume, no curvature (see below).
- **Lie groups and matrix groups.** `LieGroup` in

  `Matrix.specialOrthogonalGroup` in `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/UnitaryGroup.lean`.
- **Knot-adjacent algebra.** `Quandle` (the only knot-adjacent file upstream) in
  `Mathlib/Algebra/Quandle.lean`; presented monoids (the seed for braid groups, from
  Hannah Fechtner's program) in `Mathlib/Algebra/PresentedMonoid/Basic.lean`. Both feed
  layer 4's knot theory (colourings and braid groups), built here and consumed in turn by
  the combinatorial Heegaard Floer roadmap's Lane K.

Everything geometric-topological past this smooth-manifold-and-tangent-bundle level is
missing from Mathlib: the PL and Top structure groups, gluing and surgery, knot theory, the
diffeomorphism-group topology, and the geometric-structure layers (Riemannian volume,
hyperbolic and Thurston geometries, Heegaard genus, foliations, triangulations). Each layer
below says exactly what it starts from and what is absent, so the build list is the layers
themselves rather than a separate enumeration here.

## The layers, bottom-up from Mathlib

Ordered roughly from "closest to Mathlib" to "furthest". The early layers are
high-leverage and close to Mathlib; the geometric-structures layers are the hardest. Each
layer below records what it starts from (in Mathlib or an earlier layer), what to build
(with illustrative target shapes, not yet compiled), the design pitfalls, and the Kirby
problems it would let us *state*. The ordering and granularity are a first cut, offered to
be argued with: layers 1 and 5 in particular could be split further, and layers 7 and 8
share a Riemannian substrate that could be its own node.

PL topology runs through two of these layers and the two accounts must agree: layer 1
builds it the chart-based way (a `PLGroupoid` of piecewise-linear transition maps, parallel
to `contDiffGroupoid`), and layer 11 builds it the simplicial way (combinatorial manifolds,
the complexes whose vertex links are spheres or balls). The reconciliation theorem
(layer 11) that the polyhedron of a combinatorial manifold is a PL manifold, and
conversely, is what ties them together, and is the reason layer 1's `PLGroupoid` should be
shaped with that proof in mind.

### Layer 1: manifold-library buildout (general dimension, general structure group)

This is the spine. Almost everything below needs to cut a manifold open along a
submanifold and reglue, and none of it exists in Mathlib today. The work splits into a
*gluing* track and a *structure-group* track. The comparison between the smooth, PL, and
topological structures, where the two tracks would meet, is a major sub-project in its own
right and is flagged separately below rather than treated as a quick deliverable.

**From Mathlib.** `ModelWithCorners 𝕜 E H` and `IsManifold I n M`
(`Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/IsManifold/Basic.lean`); the boundary and interior of a
manifold as sets, `I.boundary M : Set M`, `I.interior M`, with `I.IsBoundaryPoint`,
`I.IsInteriorPoint`, and `univ_eq_interior_union_boundary`
(`Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/IsManifold/InteriorBoundary.lean`); the half-space and
quadrant models `modelWithCornersEuclideanHalfSpace n` and `modelWithCornersEuclideanQuadrant n`
(`Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/Instances/Real.lean`); `StructureGroupoid H`, `Pregroupoid H`,
and the constructor `Pregroupoid.groupoid` (`Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/StructureGroupoid.lean`);
`contDiffGroupoid`, `analyticGroupoid`, and `continuousGroupoid`.

**What to build, gluing track.**
- **Boundary as a manifold.** `I.boundary M` is currently only a set; promote it to a
  boundaryless `C^n` manifold one dimension lower, with its inclusion a smooth embedding.
  This is the prerequisite for every gluing below. ⚠ "One dimension lower" hides a model
  choice: `ModelWithCorners` does not hand you a canonical boundary model. Pin it by starting
  with the finite-dimensional real half-space model `modelWithCornersEuclideanHalfSpace n`,
  whose boundary model is `ℝ^(n-1)` (the coordinate hyperplane), and proving chart transitions
  restrict to it; generalise to other models (and corners, whose boundary is again a
  manifold-with-corners) only afterwards.
- **Collar neighbourhoods.** A boundary component has a neighbourhood diffeomorphic to
  `∂M × [0, 1)` (the collar theorem; Hirsch, *Differential Topology*, GTM 33, Theorem 6.1,
  [extract](references/hirsch-collar.md); Lee, *Introduction to Smooth Manifolds*, GTM 218,
  2nd ed., Theorem 9.25, [extract](references/lee-smooth-collar.md)). Collars are what make a
  gluing smooth rather than merely topological, and they feed the well-definedness proofs.
- **Gluing along a piece of the boundary.** The general operation glues a codimension-0
  submanifold-with-corners `A ⊆ ∂M` to one `B ⊆ ∂N` along a diffeomorphism `f : A ≃ₘ B`,
  producing `M ∪_f N` with corners along `∂A`. Full-boundary gluing is the special case
  `A = ∂M`, `B = ∂N`; **handle attachment** is `N` a handle `Dᵏ × Dⁿ⁻ᵏ` glued along
  `Sᵏ⁻¹ × Dⁿ⁻ᵏ ⊆ ∂N`; and partial gluings (a rectangle onto a disc along two of its edges,
  say) are the same def with `A`, `B` proper faces. Set this up for arbitrary manifolds, not
  only handles, because everything downstream (surgery, handlebodies, cobordism
  composition) is a special case of it.
- **Tubular neighbourhoods.** A closed submanifold has a neighbourhood diffeomorphic to the
  total space of its normal bundle (tubular neighbourhood theorem; Hirsch GTM 33, Theorem 6.3,
  [extract](references/hirsch-tubular-neighbourhood.md); Lee GTM 218, Theorem 6.24,
  [extract](references/lee-smooth-tubular.md)), consuming Mathlib's smooth vector bundles; the
  disc- and sphere-bundle versions are the surgery interface for layer 5.
- **Connected sum, with the choices explicit.** The definition must *take* the data it
  depends on: an orientation on each summand and an embedding of the closed `n`-ball into
  each, inducing opposite orientations; `M # N` deletes the open balls and glues along the
  resulting spheres. Independence of the balls is then a *theorem*, not part of the
  definition, proved from the disc theorem (any two orientation-compatible ball embeddings
  into a connected manifold are ambient isotopic; Palais, *Extending diffeomorphisms*, Proc.
  AMS 11 (1960) 274–277; Hirsch GTM 33, Chapter 4 §6, Theorem 6.6,
  [extract](references/hirsch-disc-theorem.md)). A downstream wrapper then picks the balls on
  a connected oriented manifold and inherits well-definedness from that theorem.

```lean

-- theorem connSum_sphere (M) : connSum M (sphere n) ≃ₘ M
```

**What to build, structure-group track.**
- **The PL pregroupoid, spelled out.** Capitalised `PLPregroupoid`. The underlying predicate
  is *not* "affine on the pieces of a finite triangulation": open subsets of the model are
  non-compact, so the right notion is local and locally finite. A continuous `f : U → model`
  on an open `U` is PL if every point of `U` has a neighbourhood on which `f` is affine on
  each cell of a *locally finite* polyhedral subdivision, equivalently (Rourke–Sanderson,
  *Introduction to PL Topology*, Chapters 1–2) if the graph of `f` near each point is a
  polyhedron. This predicate is what must satisfy Mathlib's `Pregroupoid` laws (locality,
  restriction to opens, closure under composition, identity), and the locally-finite
  formulation is exactly what makes restriction-to-opens and composition hold; a
  finite-pieces formulation fails restriction. Build the predicate for the half-space and
  quadrant models too, so PL manifolds-with-corners are available. Then
  `PLGroupoid := PLPregroupoid.groupoid`, and a PL manifold is `HasGroupoid M PLGroupoid`.
- **The one genuine groupoid inclusion**, `PLGroupoid ≤ continuousGroupoid` (PL maps are
  continuous), giving the forgetful "PL implies Top". ⚠ There is *no* inclusion
  `contDiffGroupoid ≤ PLGroupoid`: a smooth transition map is not literally PL. The relation
  between smooth and PL structures is the Whitehead smoothing comparison, deferred to its own
  far-horizon section near the end of this roadmap; it is a map between structures rather than
  a containment of groupoids, and it is not cheap.

**The smoothing-and-triangulation comparison** between the smooth, PL, and topological
structures (where the gluing and structure-group tracks would meet) is a major sub-project
of its own and is deliberately *not* part of the early layer-1 work. It has its own section
near the end of this roadmap, after the layers, so no one starts it before the substrate it
compares even exists.

**Design notes.** Keep orientability a separate predicate, not bundled into the manifold
(the connected-sum API above already depends on this). State gluing in the corners category
from the start, since gluing along a proper face of the boundary *produces* corners along
the seam, so the API must already live there to compose with itself. Define `PLGroupoid` so
that layer 11's link-condition definition of a combinatorial manifold can be *proved
equivalent* to it (the "combinatorial manifold = PL manifold" reconciliation; Rourke–Sanderson,
Chapter 3); this is the concrete sense in which the chart-based and simplicial accounts of
PL topology must agree, and it is why the locally-finite predicate above is the right one, a
triangulation gives exactly locally finite affine pieces.

**Unlocks.** Smoothability of `⋆RP⁴ # ⋆CP²`, `[Kir97, Problem 4.82]` (connected sum plus a
smooth structure on a fake `RP⁴`), and, as infrastructure, every gluing and surgery below.

### Layer 2: locally flat embeddings in general dimension

Topological manifolds have embeddings that are pathological in ways smooth embeddings are
not (wild arcs, the Alexander horned sphere), so the statements in this corner of topology
quantify over *locally flat* embeddings: a topological embedding `f : N → M` is locally
flat if every point of `f(N)` has a chart of `M` in which `f(N)` is a coordinate slice
`ℝⁿ ⊆ ℝᵐ`. lean-eval already carries a usable encoding via partial-homeomorphism model
charts; this layer generalises it to a reusable definition.

**From Mathlib / earlier layers.** `Homeomorph`, `IsEmbedding`, `IsOpenEmbedding`
(`Mathlib/Topology/Maps/Basic.lean`); the chart machinery of `ChartedSpace` and the
topological-manifold structure group `continuousGroupoid` (layer 1).

**What to build.**
- The predicate **`IsLocallyFlat f`** for a topological embedding `f : N → M` of topological
  manifolds (allowing boundary), via "a slice chart `ℝⁿ ⊆ ℝᵐ` exists at every image point".
  The general theory is Daverman–Venema, *Embeddings in Manifolds* (GSM 106).
- **The structural API**, which is most of the work and what every later use depends on.
  Local flatness is a *local* condition (it holds iff it holds near each image point), so the
  load-bearing content is its closure properties:
  - **restriction**: `f` restricted to an open `U ⊆ N`, or corestricted to an open `V ⊆ M`
    containing the image, stays locally flat;
  - **homeomorphism invariance**: `h ∘ f ∘ k` is locally flat for homeomorphisms `h` of the
    codomain and `k` of the domain, and more generally for chart maps and open embeddings on
    either side;
  - **products**: `f × g` is locally flat, since a product of slice charts is a slice chart;
    this is the building block for the product regions below;
  - **composition**: hypotheses under which `N ↪ M` and `M ↪ P` locally flat give `N ↪ P`
    locally flat. ⚠ This is *not* a free consequence of the definition; the two flattening
    charts have to be made compatible, so state it with explicit hypotheses rather than
    assuming it.
  These mirror Mathlib's `IsEmbedding` / `IsOpenEmbedding` closure lemmas, and are the
  reusable surface the rest of the roadmap calls.
- **Codimension-1 collaring** (Brown): a locally flat embedded `(n-1)`-manifold in an
  `n`-manifold is locally bicollared, and a locally flat `(n-1)`-sphere in `Sⁿ` is globally
  bicollared (Brown, *Locally flat imbeddings of topological manifolds*, Ann. of Math. 75
  (1962) 331–341). This is the structural theorem the Annulus Conjecture rests on, and the
  place local flatness does real work: it is false for the wild Alexander horned sphere.
- **Smooth and PL embeddings are locally flat**, stated against layer 1's structure groups,
  so the low-codimension subtleties are isolated in this one predicate.
- **The Annulus Conjecture**, stated from the right hypothesis: two *disjoint* locally flat
  `(n-1)`-spheres in `ℝⁿ`, one inside the region bounded by the other, cobound a closed
  region homeomorphic to `Sⁿ⁻¹ × [0,1]`. The input is two spheres; that the region between
  them is a product is the whole content, and is false without local flatness. (The earlier
  draft instead assumed an embedded annulus and concluded an annulus, which is circular.)

```lean
-- def IsLocallyFlat (f : N → M) : Prop := IsEmbedding f ∧ ∀ x, ∃ chart …, IsSlice chart (f x)
-- theorem IsLocallyFlat.restrict … ; theorem IsLocallyFlat.comp_homeomorph … ; theorem IsLocallyFlat.prod …
-- theorem isLocallyFlat_of_smoothEmbedding … : IsLocallyFlat f
-- theorem bicollared_of_locallyFlat_sphere … :  -- Brown: a locally flat Sⁿ⁻¹ ⊆ Sⁿ is bicollared
-- theorem annulus_conjecture (Σ₁ Σ₂ : LocallyFlatSphere (n-1) (ℝ^n)) (h : Σ₂ ⊆ inside Σ₁) :
--     regionBetween Σ₁ Σ₂ ≃ₜ (sphere (n-1) ×ₜ I)
```

**Design notes.** Do not bake a codimension into `IsLocallyFlat`: codimension 0 (open
embeddings, trivially flat), codimension 1 (collaring), and codimension 2 (where knotting
lives) behave differently, and isolating them in one predicate is the point. The Annulus
Conjecture reduces to the Stable Homeomorphism Conjecture (Kirby's route in dimension
`≥ 5`); record that as the intended proof even though only the statement is the target. The
companion notion, a locally flat submanifold with a topological normal bundle, is more
delicate in positive codimension (Kirby–Siebenmann) and is what layer 5's topological
surgery would consume; flag it as a dependency rather than building it here.

**Unlocks.** The Annulus Conjecture (Kirby 1969 in dimension `≥ 5`; Quinn 1982 in
dimension 4; no Kirby number): two disjoint nested locally flat spheres cobound a product
region.

### Layer 3: diffeomorphism groups with the C^∞ topology

The Smale conjecture and its 4-dimensional cousin are statements about the *homotopy type*
of the group `Diff(M)` of self-diffeomorphisms. To state them we need `Diff(M)` as a
topological group, with the C^∞ (weak Whitney) topology, for general manifolds. Mathlib has
the `Diffeomorph` type but no group object and no topology on it; lean-eval currently dodges
this with an ad-hoc "relative parameterized" form, which this layer is meant to retire.

**From Mathlib / earlier layers.** `Diffeomorph` (`structure Diffeomorph extends M ≃ M'`,
notation `M ≃ₘ^n⟮I, I'⟯ M'`) in `Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/Diffeomorph.lean`; bundled
smooth maps `ContMDiffMap` (`Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/ContMDiffMap.lean`); the
topological-group and uniform-space API from Mathlib's algebra-and-topology libraries;
`HomotopyGroup` (`Mathlib/Topology/Homotopy/HomotopyGroup.lean`) for the conclusions.

**What to build.**
- The **group** `Diff(M) := M ≃ₘ^∞⟮I, I⟯ M` under composition (the `Group` instance is
  routine from the existing `Diffeomorph` composition and inverse).
- The **C^∞ topology**, pinned to one construction to avoid the weak/strong/compact-open
  ambiguity: for `M` compact, give the space of smooth maps `C^∞(M, M)` the *initial topology
  induced by all iterated derivatives read in charts* (the compact case, where weak and strong
  Whitney agree; Hirsch, *Differential Topology* GTM 33, Chapter 2,
  [extract](references/hirsch-smooth-map-topologies.md)), and define `Diff(M)` as a subtype of
  `Diffeomorph`/`ContMDiffMap` with the subspace topology, making it a topological group.
  `Diff(M, ∂M)` is the closed subgroup fixing `∂M` pointwise, for the relative statements.
  (The non-compact case is a separate, later choice; do not bake it in.)
- The **smooth-families map** (note: a map, not an equivalence). A smooth `F : P × M → M`
  that is a diffeomorphism in `M` for each `p` induces a continuous `P → Diff(M)`; this is the
  direction the layer exists to provide (it turns "smooth family", what proofs produce, into
  "map into the group", what homotopy-type statements need). ⚠ The converse is *not* an
  equivalence for arbitrary `P`; state it only as the forward map, with the reverse direction a
  separate target under explicit hypotheses on `P`.
- The reference inclusion `O(n+1) → Diff(Sⁿ)` (consume `Matrix.orthogonalGroup`, layer 7's
  isometry action, and the sphere instance) as a continuous group homomorphism.

```lean
-- instance : Group (Diff I M)
-- instance : TopologicalGroup (Diff I M)   -- the C^∞ topology (initial topology in charts), M compact
-- def ofSmoothFamily (F : P × M → M) (h : ∀ p, IsDiffeo (F p ·)) : C(P, Diff I M) := …  -- forward only
-- theorem smale_conjecture : Nonempty (HomotopyEquiv (Diff 𝓘 (sphere 3)) (orthogonalGroup 4 ℝ))
```

**Design notes.** State the Smale conjecture as a homotopy equivalence of the underlying
spaces, not as an isomorphism of homotopy groups, so it is not silently weaker; the
inclusion `O(4) → Diff(S³)` being a homotopy equivalence is the sharp form. For Watanabe's
disproof, the right target is that a specific element of `π_k(Diff(D⁴, ∂))` (a Hatcher–Wagoner
or graph-clasper class) is nonzero, which needs `Diff(M, ∂M)` and its homotopy groups, not
just `π₀`. Keep "compact `M`" and "`M` with boundary, fixing the boundary" as separate
named setups.

**Unlocks.** The Smale conjecture `Diff(S³) ≃ O(4)` (Hatcher), `[Kir97, Problem 4.34]`, and
Watanabe's disproof of the 4-dimensional Smale conjecture, `[Kir97, Problem 4.126]`.

### Layer 4: knot theory, done properly (owned here)

This is a whole subproject and the most glaring gap: Mathlib has nothing knot-theoretic
beyond `Quandle`. The lean-eval Piccirillo and Conway-knot statements are, frankly, an
ad-hoc disaster, and cleaning them up means building real foundations. The design
commitment, shared with the combinatorial Heegaard Floer roadmap, is **no privileged
representation**: a knot is not "an embedding `S¹ ↪ S³`" any more than it is "a diagram",
and the content is in the *types of presentation*, the *maps between them*, and the
theorems saying when two presentations give the same knot.

**From Mathlib / earlier layers.** `Quandle` (`Mathlib/Algebra/Quandle.lean`) as the seed
for diagram colourings; `PresentedMonoid` (`Mathlib/Algebra/PresentedMonoid/Basic.lean`,
from Hannah Fechtner's braid program) for braid groups; smooth embeddings
(`IsSmoothEmbedding`) and the sphere instance for the geometric presentation; layer 1's
manifolds for complements (handed on to layer 5).

**What to build.**
- **The presentations, as first-class types carrying orientation and framing** (Lickorish,
  *An Introduction to Knot Theory*, GTM 175, is the spine throughout this layer; per-topic
  extracts are in [references/](references/)). Per the encoding conventions there is **no
  umbrella `Knot` type**: the presentations are first-class types, and the geometric one is
  simply a smooth embedding `S¹ ↪ M`, worked over a general manifold `M` and specialised to
  `ℝ³` or `S³`. The presentations are smooth and PL embeddings `S¹ ↪ M`; PL polylines; braid
  closures (over `PresentedMonoid` braid groups with the Artin relations); knot diagrams as
  4-valent planar graphs with crossing signs, and the equivalent oriented PD codes and Gauss
  codes. From the start each
  presentation carries **orientation** (a direction on the knot) and **framing** (a chosen
  push-off, blackboard or Seifert), with **forgetful maps** dropping that data, so
  framed-and-oriented, oriented, and unoriented knots are connected by forgetful maps and
  every theorem assumes only the structure it needs. Each is a `Type`, with the realization
  and forgetful maps to the others (a braid word closes to a diagram; a diagram realizes to
  a PL knot).
- **Equivalence in each presentation, and the correspondences between them (the hard part,
  flagged as such).** Each presentation has its own equivalence: ambient isotopy for the
  geometric presentation (the general `Isotopic` of the encoding conventions, specialised to
  smooth embeddings `S¹ ↪ M`, so isotopy is defined once for arbitrary maps and reused),
  Reidemeister moves (diagrams), Markov moves (braids), stellar moves (polylines), grid moves
  (grids, from the combinatorial Heegaard Floer roadmap). The correspondences split into two
  regimes of very different difficulty:
  - **Combinatorial to combinatorial** (diagram, braid, grid, PD/Gauss): the equivalences
    are finite local moves, so the correspondences are themselves combinatorial and can be
    established move-by-move (Markov's theorem for braid-to-diagram, Cromwell's for
    grid-to-diagram). Tedious but elementary.
  - **Geometric to combinatorial** (a smooth or PL embedding to its diagram): genuinely hard.
    Producing a diagram is a generic projection (general position), and proving "isotopic iff
    Reidemeister-equivalent" means controlling an ambient isotopy as the projection passes
    through codimension-1 degeneracies, a one-parameter general-position (Cerf-theoretic)
    argument. This is where the foundational difficulty lives, and where the Isabelle/AFP and
    Lean `leanknot` experiments stalled; flag it as a major target, and let the rest of the
    layer not wait on it.
  - **Which correspondences to develop.** Do not aim for all pairwise equivalences (the
    complete graph on presentations). Pick a **spanning tree** anchored at the diagram as the
    hub (most invariants are defined from diagrams), with the single expensive
    geometric-to-diagram edge that everything routes through, and add a few direct edges only
    where they are cheap or load-bearing (grid-to-diagram for the Heegaard Floer roadmap,
    braid-to-diagram via Markov). Each extra edge is a convenience theorem, not a
    prerequisite; the tree is what the rest of the layer actually needs.
- **Slice-ness, stated cleanly** on a presentation `K` (by default a smooth embedding
  `S¹ ↪ S³`). `IsSmoothlySlice K` (`K` bounds a smoothly embedded disc in `D⁴`) and
  `IsTopologicallySlice K` (a *locally flat* disc, consuming layer 2 and the topological
  4-manifold input of layer 6); the slice genus `g_s(K)` and the topological slice genus.
  These replace the lean-eval monstrosities with one-line definitions.
- **Knot polynomials, each a project in itself, with several algorithms apiece.** The
  Alexander polynomial (Conway normalization), Jones, and HOMFLY; each is a substantial
  sub-project, and we will likely want **multiple algorithms for the same invariant, starting
  from different presentations**, with theorems that they agree: Alexander from a Seifert
  matrix, from the Conway skein relation on a diagram, and from the Burau representation of a
  braid; Jones from the Kauffman bracket on a diagram and from the Temperley–Lieb / Jones
  representation of a braid. The agreement theorems (same invariant, different route) are as
  much of the value as the algorithms, and they exercise the presentation correspondences
  above; they also let the acceptance criteria evaluate the invariants on small knots.

```lean

-- def SmoothLink (M) : Type := { f : C^∞(circle, M) // IsEmbedding f }   -- geometric presentation, general M

```

**Convention table (pin before stating anything).** Every theorem below silently depends on
these; fix them once.

| item | convention |
| --- | --- |
| ambient space | standard orientation on `ℝ³` / `S³` |
| knot orientation | oriented by default; the unoriented version is the image of the forgetful map |
| crossing sign | a right-handed crossing counts `+1` |
| mirror, reverse | mirror is reflection (negates every crossing); reverse flips the orientation |
| framing | the Seifert (`0`-) framing is the canonical longitude; the blackboard framing equals the writhe |
| Alexander | Conway-normalised: `Δ_K(t) = Δ_K(t⁻¹)`, `Δ_unknot = 1`; right-handed trefoil `Δ = t − 1 + t⁻¹` |
| Jones | via the Kauffman bracket with `t = A⁻⁴` and `V_unknot = 1`; fix the trefoil value from Lickorish, [references/lickorish-jones.md](references/lickorish-jones.md) |

**Design notes.** Keep "smoothly slice" and "topologically slice" rigorously separate; the
gap between them is the entire point of `[Kir97, 1.41]` and `[Kir97, 1.36]`. Coordinate the
braid-group and diagram-calculus work with the combinatorial Heegaard Floer roadmap's Lane K
(which adds the grid-diagram presentation and Cromwell's theorem) rather than duplicating it;
that roadmap's `τ` is a consumer of these presentations.

**Unlocks.** `0`-shake genus vs slice genus, `[Kir97, Problem 1.41]` (Piccirillo, via the
Conway knot, jointly with the combinatorial Heegaard Floer roadmap's `τ`);
Alexander-polynomial-one knots are topologically slice, `[Kir97, Problem 1.36]` (Freedman).

### Layer 5: Dehn surgery

Surgery cuts out a tubular neighbourhood of a knot and reglues a solid torus by a boundary
diffeomorphism; the gluing class is the *slope*. This is the central construction of
3-manifold topology and the source of most of the Property-P-family Kirby problems. It is a
direct application of layer 1's gluing to layer 4's knots, plus the slope bookkeeping.

**From Mathlib / earlier layers.** Layer 1's manifold-with-boundary, tubular
neighbourhoods, and boundary-gluing; layer 4's knots and links; the torus as a manifold and
`H₁` of the boundary torus for slopes; layer 1's connected sum for the surgery-description
calculus.

**What to build.**
- **The complement** of a knot or link as a compact manifold-with-boundary: delete an open
  tubular neighbourhood (layer 1), with the boundary a torus per component. This is the
  layer-4-to-layer-5 handoff that lean-eval lacks. (Rolfsen, *Knots and Links*, Chapter 9,
  is the reference for the surgery picture throughout this layer,
  [extract](references/rolfsen-dehn-surgery.md).)
- **Slopes**, with the primitive pinned to avoid the "all of the above" trap. Take a slope
  on a boundary torus `T` to be a **primitive class in `H₁(T; ℤ)` modulo sign** (an unoriented
  essential simple closed curve); separately give a `FramedBoundaryTorus` an ordered basis
  `(μ, λ)` (meridian, Seifert longitude) and the resulting bijection `Slope T ≃ ℚ ∪ {∞}`.
  State the convention explicitly: `p/q` denotes the class `p·μ + q·λ`, and Dehn filling sends
  the filling solid torus's meridian to that class. Keep `Slope` (basis-free) and the `ℚ∪{∞}`
  parametrisation (basis-dependent) as distinct so theorems can be stated either way.
- **Dehn filling / surgery**: glue a solid torus to the complement sending its meridian to
  a chosen slope (layer 1's gluing); `n`-surgery, rational surgery, and surgery on framed
  links. General-dimension surgery on a framed embedded `Sᵏ` (cut `Sᵏ × Dⁿ⁻ᵏ`, glue
  `Dᵏ⁺¹ × Sⁿ⁻ᵏ⁻¹`) specialises to the 3-dimensional case.
- **The convention-fixing identities**: surgery on the unknot recovers known manifolds (see
  the acceptance criteria), pinning the meridian-longitude and slope conventions.

```lean
-- def complement (L : SmoothLink (sphere 3)) : Manifold …   -- compact, one torus boundary per component
-- def Slope (T : BoundaryTorus) : Type := { c : H1 T ℤ // IsPrimitive c } ⧸ sign  -- basis-free
-- def slopeEquiv (T : FramedBoundaryTorus) : Slope T.toTorus ≃ (ℚ ∪ {∞})  -- p/q ↦ p·μ + q·λ
-- def dehnFilling (M : Manifold …) (s : Slope …) : Manifold …            -- filling meridian ↦ s
-- theorem surgery_unknot_zero : dehnFilling (complement unknot) 0 ≃ₘ (circle ×ₘ sphere 2)
-- theorem surgery_unknot_pq : dehnFilling (complement unknot) (p/q) ≃ₘ lensSpace p q
```

**Design notes.** Fix the framing convention (the `0`-framing from the Seifert surface)
once and prove the unknot identities against it before stating any Kirby target, because
every surgery statement inherits that choice. Property P and Property R are statements about
*all* nontrivial knots, so they quantify over layer 4's knot type; keep "the surgered
manifold is not simply connected / is not `S¹ × S²`" as the conclusion shape. Cosmetic
surgery compares two fillings of the *same* complement, so state it as a property of the
slope pair, not of two abstract manifolds.

**Unlocks.** Property P `[Kir97, Problem 1.15]`, Property R `[Kir97, Problem 1.82]`,
Akbulut–Kirby `0`-surgery concordance `[Kir97, Problem 1.19]`, and chirally cosmetic
surgery `[Kir97, Problem 1.81]`.

### Layer 6: knot concordance and 4D cobordism (owned here)

Two knots are concordant if they cobound a smoothly (or locally flatly) embedded annulus in
`S³ × [0,1]`; concordance classes form a group under connected sum. This layer owns the
concordance group and the cobordism category, building on layer 4's knots and layer 1's
gluing, and *consumes* the homological concordance invariants (`τ`, and ideally `s`) from
the combinatorial Heegaard Floer roadmap.

**From Mathlib / earlier layers.** Layer 4's knots, slice-ness, and Seifert surfaces; layer
1's gluing and connected sum; the combinatorial Heegaard Floer roadmap's `τ` (a homomorphism
on the concordance group). The classical signature invariant is built here from layer 4's
Seifert matrix.

**What to build.**
- The **concordance relation** and the **concordance group** `C` (smooth and topological
  variants), stated on layer 4's geometric presentation (smooth embeddings `S¹ ↪ S³`), not on
  any `Knot` type: concordance is the specialisation of the general `Isotopic`/cobordism
  machinery to a locally flat or smooth annulus in `S³ × [0,1]`. Connected sum is the group
  operation and the reverse mirror the inverse; the slice presentations form the identity
  coset. (Livingston, *A survey of classical knot concordance*, is the orienting reference.)
- The **4D cobordism category** in general dimension: oriented cobordisms between manifolds,
  composition by gluing (layer 1), and knot/link cobordisms as surfaces in `S³ × [0,1]`,
  with genus giving the concordance and slice genera.
- **The 4-manifold input to topological sliceness** that Freedman's theorem needs:
  topologically locally flat surfaces in `D⁴` (consuming layer 2) and the existence of
  locally flat slice discs for Alexander-polynomial-one knots. This is 4-dimensional
  topology rather than homology, which is why it lives here rather than in the combinatorial
  Heegaard Floer roadmap; layer 4's `IsTopologicallySlice` and the Freedman unlock consume
  it.
- **Concordance invariants**: the Tristram–Levine signature function from layer 4's Seifert
  matrix (built here), and the import of `τ : C → ℤ` and `s` as consumers of the
  combinatorial Heegaard Floer roadmap.
- **Mutation** as an operation on knots (Conway mutation by a `(±1)`-tangle replacement) and
  the statement that it does *not* preserve the smooth concordance class.

```lean
-- K, K' : SmoothLink (sphere 3)   -- the geometric presentation; no `Knot` type
-- def Concordant (K K' : SmoothLink (sphere 3)) : Prop := ∃ Σ : Annulus (sphere 3 ×ₘ I), boundary Σ = K ⊔ K'.mirror
-- instance : Group (Quotient concordanceSetoid)   -- concordance classes; # as operation
-- def signature (K : SmoothLink (sphere 3)) (ω : Circle) : ℤ   -- Tristram–Levine, from the Seifert form
-- theorem mutation_not_concordance_invariant : ∃ K, ¬ Concordant K (mutate K)
-- theorem levine_homologySphere_not_S3 : -- a knot in a homology sphere not smoothly concordant to any in S³
```

**Design notes.** Keep smooth and topological concordance separate from the start; the
Levine and mutation results are about the smooth category specifically. The signature is
elementary and self-contained (a good first target); `τ` and `s` arrive later as imports,
so state the signature results without waiting on them. Concordance in homology spheres
(`[Kir97, 1.31]`) needs the knot type generalized to ambient homology spheres, which is a
small extension of layer 4's geometric presentation; note it as a dependency.

**Unlocks.** Conway mutation does not preserve concordance, `[Kir97, Problem 1.53]`;
concordance of knots in homology spheres to knots in `S³`, `[Kir97, Problem 1.31]` (Levine,
disproved smoothly).

### Layer 7: Riemannian geometric structures and volume

Mathlib's Riemannian library reaches the metric-and-distance level but stops short of
volume and curvature, which is exactly what the hyperbolic-geometry Kirby problems need. To
state "the Weeks manifold has the smallest volume" we need a Riemannian volume measure, a
notion of hyperbolic (complete, constant curvature `−1`) structure, and the resulting
volume invariant. This is the hardest layer that is still close to existing Mathlib.

**From Mathlib / earlier layers.** `RiemannianBundle` and `IsRiemannianManifold`, the
induced `riemannianEDist`, and `EMetricSpace.ofRiemannianMetric`
(`Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/Riemannian/Basic.lean`); path length in
`Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/Riemannian/PathELength.lean`; Mathlib's measure theory and the
`volume` measure on `ℝⁿ`; layer 1's manifolds; `Matrix.orthogonalGroup` for isometry
groups.

**What to build.**
- The **Riemannian volume measure** from the metric (the density `√det g` in charts,
  assembled with a partition of unity), and its invariance under isometries; the total
  **volume** of a closed Riemannian manifold as a real number.
- **Curvature**: the Levi-Civita connection, the Riemann curvature tensor, and sectional
  and Ricci curvature, enough to *state* "constant sectional curvature `κ`" (Lee,
  *Introduction to Riemannian Manifolds*, GTM 176, for the volume form and curvature,
  [extract](references/lee-riemannian-volume-curvature.md); Thurston, *Three-Dimensional
  Geometry and Topology*, [extract](references/thurston-hyperbolic-structures.md), and
  Ratcliffe, *Foundations of Hyperbolic Manifolds*, GTM 149, for the hyperbolic side and
  Mostow rigidity, [extract](references/ratcliffe-mostow-rigidity.md)).
- **Hyperbolic structures**, with the volume problem handled by separating *data* from
  *property*. A bare `IsHyperbolic M := ∃ g, …` carries no metric to integrate, so volume is
  not definable from it. Instead build a bundled `HyperbolicMetric M` (a complete metric of
  constant curvature `−1`, on the model `ℍⁿ`), define `hypVolumeOfMetric : HyperbolicMetric M → ℝ`
  by integrating its Riemannian volume, and make Mostow invariance a *theorem*
  (`hypVolumeOfMetric g = hypVolumeOfMetric g'` in dimension `≥ 3`), which then licenses a
  metric-independent `hypVolume M` from `Nonempty (HyperbolicMetric M)`. `IsHyperbolic M` stays
  as the existence predicate; the Weeks target uses `hypVolume`, not the predicate.
- **Fibering and Haken-ness** for layer 7's second problem: a 3-manifold *fibers over the
  circle* (is a mapping torus), is *Haken* (contains an incompressible surface), and is
  *virtually* so (a finite cover is).

```lean
-- noncomputable def riemannianVolume (M) [IsRiemannianManifold I M] : Measure M := …
-- noncomputable def volume (M) [Closed M] [IsRiemannianManifold I M] : ℝ := (riemannianVolume M) univ
-- structure HyperbolicMetric (M) where metric : RiemannianMetric M; complete : …; curv : sectionalCurvature metric = -1
-- noncomputable def hypVolumeOfMetric (g : HyperbolicMetric M) : ℝ := riemannianVolume g.metric univ
-- theorem hypVolume_indep (g g' : HyperbolicMetric M) [Closed M] (h : 3 ≤ dim M) : hypVolumeOfMetric g = hypVolumeOfMetric g'  -- Mostow
-- noncomputable def hypVolume (M) [Closed M] (h : Nonempty (HyperbolicMetric M)) : ℝ := …  -- via hypVolume_indep
-- theorem weeks_minimal_volume (M) (h : ClosedOrientableHyperbolic3 M) : hypVolume weeksManifold ≤ hypVolume M
-- theorem agol_virtually_fibered (M) (h : ClosedHyperbolic3 M) : ∃ N, FiniteCover N M ∧ FibersOverCircle N
```

**Design notes.** Volume well-definedness for hyperbolic manifolds rides on Mostow
rigidity, so state hyperbolic volume against an *explicit* complete hyperbolic metric and
make Mostow-invariance a separate theorem rather than baking it into the definition. The
Weeks manifold needs a concrete construction (as a surgery on the Whitehead link, layer 5,
or by face-pairings of a polytope); pick one and make "this is the Weeks manifold" a
definition, not a black box. Keep "fibers over `S¹`", "Haken", and "virtually X" as
separate predicates; Agol's theorem is a chain of them.

**Unlocks.** Virtual fibering and virtually Haken, `[Kir97, Problem 3.51]` (Agol); the
smallest-volume closed orientable hyperbolic 3-manifold is the Weeks manifold,
`[Kir97, Problem 3.60]` (Gabai–Meyerhoff–Milley).

### Layer 8: Thurston geometries and the JSJ / geometric decomposition

Geometrization is much harder to *state* than the Poincaré conjecture, because its
conclusion is structural: not "homeomorphic to a fixed model" but "cut along canonical
tori, every piece carries one of eight geometries". So the work here is mostly in the
definitions, and stating the theorem faithfully is the deliverable.

**From Mathlib / earlier layers.** Layer 7's Riemannian and hyperbolic structures and
isometry groups; layer 5's torus complements and gluing; layer 1's manifolds; Lie groups
(`Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/Algebra/LieGroup.lean`) for the model-geometry isometry groups.

**What to build.**
- The **eight model geometries** as homogeneous Riemannian 3-manifolds `(X, Isom X)`:
  `S³`, `E³`, `ℍ³`, `S² × ℝ`, `ℍ² × ℝ`, `SL₂~`, `Nil`, `Sol`, each with its maximal
  isometry group (Scott, *The geometries of 3-manifolds*, is the canonical account); a
  **geometric structure** on `M` as a complete locally homogeneous metric modeled on one of
  them (equivalently `M = X / Γ` for a discrete `Γ ≤ Isom X`).
- **Incompressible tori** and the **JSJ decomposition**, modeled as a decomposition *object*,
  not a `Finset` of tori (a finite set of embedded tori would need an artificial `DecidableEq`
  and would drop the cutting data). A `JSJDecomposition M` bundles the family of disjoint
  incompressible embedded tori, the resulting pieces, the boundary identifications recovering
  `M`, and the proof each piece is Seifert-fibered or atoroidal; existence and canonicity (up
  to isotopy) are then *theorems* about this object, not built into a `def JSJ`.
- **Geometrization** as the statement that each piece of the JSJ decomposition of a closed
  orientable prime 3-manifold admits a geometric structure (after also splitting along the
  prime/connected-sum decomposition, which is layer 1).

```lean
-- structure ModelGeometry where X : Manifold …; isom : LieGroup …; homogeneous : …
-- def HasGeometricStructure (M) (G : ModelGeometry) : Prop := ∃ metric, LocallyHomogeneous metric G
-- structure JSJDecomposition (M) where
--   tori : Finset ι; emb : ι → EmbeddedTorus M; disjoint : …; incompressible : …
--   pieces : Finset Piece; cut : M ≃ₜ glueUp pieces; seifertOrAtoroidal : ∀ p ∈ pieces, …
-- theorem jsj_exists_unique (M : ClosedOrientablePrime3) : ∃ J : JSJDecomposition M, …  -- canonical up to isotopy
-- theorem geometrization (M : ClosedOrientablePrime3) (J : JSJDecomposition M) :
--     ∀ p ∈ J.pieces, ∃ G : ModelGeometry, HasGeometricStructure p G
```

**Design notes.** State the prime decomposition (connected-sum, layer 1) and the JSJ
(torus, here) as two separate canonical decompositions, then geometrization as "each atomic
piece is geometric"; bundling them obscures which uniqueness theorem is doing the work. The
eight geometries are a *closed* list, so encode them as an enumeration with proofs that
each is genuinely homogeneous, not as an open-ended class. The Poincaré conjecture is the
special case "`S³` is the only simply-connected closed 3-manifold" and falls out as an
instance.

**Unlocks.** Geometrization, `[Kir97, Problem 3.45]` (Perelman).

### Layer 9: Heegaard splittings and Heegaard genus

Every closed 3-manifold splits into two handlebodies glued along a surface; the minimal
genus of such a surface is the Heegaard genus, a basic 3-manifold invariant. Waldhausen
asked whether it equals the rank of the fundamental group; the answer is no, and stating
the disproof needs the genus and the rank side by side.

**From Mathlib / earlier layers.** Layer 1's handlebodies (a handlebody is a boundary-sum
of solid tori, built from layer 1's gluing) and boundary-gluing; `FundamentalGroup`
(`Mathlib/AlgebraicTopology/FundamentalGroupoid/`) and `Group.rank` for the rank side; the
surface (closed orientable 2-manifold) classification for the splitting surface.

**What to build.**
- **Handlebodies** of each genus and the **Heegaard splitting** of a closed 3-manifold as
  a decomposition `M = H₁ ∪_φ H₂` along a genus-`g` surface, with `φ` a surface
  diffeomorphism (consume layer 3's surface mapping classes; Scharlemann, *Heegaard
  splittings of compact 3-manifolds*, is the survey).
- **Heegaard genus** `g(M)` as the minimum genus over all splittings, with existence (every
  closed 3-manifold has a splitting, from a triangulation or a Morse function) so the
  minimum is over a nonempty set.
- The **rank** of `π₁(M)` (minimal number of generators) and the inequality
  `rank π₁(M) ≤ g(M)`, which is the easy direction; Waldhausen asked about equality.

```lean
-- def Handlebody (g : ℕ) : Manifold …
-- structure HeegaardSplitting (M) where g : ℕ; glue : (Handlebody g).boundary ≃ₘ (Handlebody g).boundary; iso : M ≃ₘ …
-- def genera (M : ClosedOrientable3) : Set ℕ := { g | ∃ s : HeegaardSplitting M, s.g = g }
-- noncomputable def heegaardGenus (M) [Nonempty (HeegaardSplitting M)] : ℕ := Nat.find (existence proof)  -- least genus
-- theorem rank_le_heegaardGenus (M) : groupRank (FundamentalGroup M) ≤ heegaardGenus M  -- check the Mathlib rank API
-- theorem waldhausen_false : ∃ M, groupRank (FundamentalGroup M) < heegaardGenus M
```

**Design notes.** Take the genus as the least element of a *proved-nonempty* set of splitting
genera (`Nat.find`/`sInf` under `[Nonempty (HeegaardSplitting M)]`), with existence proved
first, so `heegaardGenus` is never silently `0`; a raw `⨅` over a possibly-empty type is the
trap to avoid. ⚠ Confirm the rank invariant exists in the intended form: Mathlib may not
provide exactly `Group.rank (FundamentalGroup M)`, so name the minimal-generators invariant
explicitly and check before relying on it. The disproof is an inequality, so the target is a
witness `M` with strict inequality, not a general formula.

**Unlocks.** Waldhausen's rank-versus-genus conjecture (disproved by Li; no Kirby number).

### Layer 10: foliations and their Euler class

A codimension-one foliation slices a 3-manifold into surfaces (leaves); its tangent plane
field is an oriented 2-plane bundle with an Euler class in `H²(M)`. Thurston conjectured a
bound on this class; Gabai and Yazdi disproved it, and stating that needs foliations and
the Euler class as first-class objects.

**From Mathlib / earlier layers.** The tangent bundle and `mfderiv`
(`Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/`); singular and the implied de Rham / `H²` cohomology for the
Euler class; vector bundles and their (to-be-built) Euler class; layer 1's manifolds.

**What to build.**
- A **foliation** of `M` as an integrable subbundle of `TM` (a distribution closed under
  Lie bracket), equivalently a maximal atlas of flat charts; **leaves** as the maximal
  integral submanifolds; **taut** foliations (a closed transversal through every leaf).
  Calegari, *Foliations and the Geometry of 3-Manifolds* (freely available online), is the
  reference.
- The **Euler class** of an oriented plane bundle in degree-2 *cohomology* (a small standalone
  addition to Mathlib's bundle theory), specialized to the tangent field of a codimension-one
  foliation. ⚠ Be explicit that this is singular *cohomology* `H²(M; ℤ)`, not homology; the
  notation in the target must name a cohomology group, since the statement pairs the class
  against surfaces.
- The **Euler-class bound** statement, with its pairing spelled out: the evaluation of a
  degree-2 class on the fundamental class `[S] ∈ H₂` of an embedded surface, the inequality
  `|⟨e(F), [S]⟩| ≤ −χ(S)` on every leaf-or-surface `S`, and a witness foliation violating it.
  Define the surface class and the pairing before the inequality.

```lean
-- structure Foliation (M) where dist : Subbundle (TangentBundle M); integrable : Involutive dist
-- def eulerClass (E : OrientedPlaneBundle M) : SingularCohomology 2 M ℤ := …     -- cohomology, not homology
-- def evalOnSurface (c : SingularCohomology 2 M ℤ) (S : EmbeddedSurface M) : ℤ := ⟨c, fundamentalClass S⟩
-- def EulerClassBounded (F : Foliation M) : Prop := ∀ S, |evalOnSurface (eulerClass F.dist) S| ≤ -eulerChar S
-- theorem gabai_yazdi : ∃ (M : ClosedHyperbolic3) (F : Foliation M), Taut F ∧ ¬ EulerClassBounded F
```

**Design notes.** The Euler-class layer is small and reusable on its own; build it against
Mathlib's vector bundles independently of foliations, then specialize. State Thurston's
conjecture as the *bounded* predicate and the Gabai–Yazdi result as its negation on an
explicit example, so the disproof is a witness rather than a universal statement.

### Layer 11: triangulations, PL structures, and collapse

This layer is the simplicial counterpart of layer 1's chart-based PL groupoid, and the two
must be proved to agree. A triangulation presents a space as the polyhedron of a simplicial
complex; a *combinatorial* manifold is a complex whose local structure (the links) forces
the polyhedron to be a manifold. Manolescu's theorem is that some topological manifolds are
not triangulable at all, and Zeeman's conjecture is about simplicial collapse, so both need
this simplicial vocabulary.

**From Mathlib / earlier layers.** Abstract simplicial complexes `AbstractSimplicialComplex`
(`Mathlib/AlgebraicTopology/SimplicialComplex/Basic.lean`); geometric simplicial complexes
in a real vector space with their underlying polyhedron `SimplicialComplex.space`
(`Mathlib/Analysis/Convex/SimplicialComplex/Basic.lean`); the simplicial-set realization
adjunction `toTopHomeo`, `|Δ[n]| ≅ stdSimplex`
(`Mathlib/AlgebraicTopology/SimplicialSet/TopAdj.lean`); layer 1's manifolds and PL
groupoid.

**What to build.**
- **Geometric realization of an abstract simplicial complex** as a topological space (the
  polyhedron `|K|`), with the basic API (faces, the star and **link** of a simplex,
  subdivision), reusing the simplicial-set realization where the indexing allows and the
  geometric `SimplicialComplex.space` otherwise.
- **Triangulation of a space** in the general sense: `IsTriangulable M := ∃ K, Nonempty (|K| ≃ₜ M)`.
  This is the notion in Manolescu's theorem, and it is *weaker* than asking for a
  combinatorial or PL structure. (Moise, *Geometric Topology in Dimensions 2 and 3*, treats
  the dimension-3 existence, [extract](references/moise-triangulation-dim3.md).)
- **Combinatorial manifolds via the link condition** (Kim's point, the simplicial side of
  PL topology). Define, recursively in dimension, a **combinatorial `n`-sphere** and
  **combinatorial `n`-ball** (a complex PL-homeomorphic, after subdivision, to the boundary
  of the standard `(n+1)`-simplex, respectively the standard `n`-simplex), bottoming out at
  the combinatorial `0`-sphere (two points) and `0`-ball (one point). Then `K` is a
  **combinatorial `n`-manifold** if the link of every vertex is a combinatorial
  `(n-1)`-sphere (interior point) or `(n-1)`-ball (boundary point). This is the definition
  that "has the correct links to be a manifold".
- **The reconciliation with layer 1.** Prove that the polyhedron of a combinatorial
  `n`-manifold is a PL `n`-manifold in the sense of layer 1's `PLGroupoid`, and conversely
  that every PL manifold admits a combinatorial triangulation (Whitehead). This is the
  theorem that makes "PL manifold via charts" and "simplicial complex with correct links"
  the same notion, and it is the concrete reason layer 1's `PLGroupoid` should be defined to
  make this proof natural. ⚠ This is genuinely subtle and not merely bookkeeping: recognizing
  a combinatorial sphere is undecidable in high dimensions (Novikov), the Hauptvermutung
  (any two triangulations have a common subdivision) is *false* for topological manifolds in
  general (so a triangulation need not give a PL structure), and a non-combinatorial
  triangulation of a manifold can exist where no combinatorial one does. Keep "triangulable",
  "combinatorially triangulable / PL", and "smoothable" as three separate predicates with
  the implications, not equalities, between them.
- **Simplicial collapse** (an elementary collapse removes a free face; `K` is collapsible if
  it collapses to a point), and **Zeeman's conjecture**: for a contractible `2`-complex `K`,
  the product `K × I` is collapsible.

```lean
-- def realize (K : AbstractSimplicialComplex ι) : TopCat := …      -- the polyhedron |K|
-- def link (K) (σ : K.faces) : AbstractSimplicialComplex ι := …
-- def IsCombinatorialManifold (K) (n : ℕ) : Prop := ∀ v, IsCombinatorialSphereOrBall (link K {v}) (n-1)
-- theorem realize_combinatorialManifold_isPL (K) (h : IsCombinatorialManifold K n) : HasGroupoid (realize K) PLGroupoid
-- def IsTriangulable (M : TopCat) : Prop := ∃ K, Nonempty (realize K ≃ₜ M)
-- theorem manolescu_not_triangulable : ∃ M : ClosedTopological5Manifold, ¬ IsTriangulable M
-- def Collapsible (K) : Prop := …
-- theorem zeeman_conjecture (K) (h : Contractible2Complex K) : Collapsible (K ×ₛ I)   -- [Kir97, 5.2]
```

**Design notes.** The combinatorial-sphere recursion is the crux; get the base cases and
the subdivision relation right before anything depends on it, since the whole link
definition rests on it. State Manolescu's theorem against the *general* triangulability
predicate (homeomorphism to any simplicial complex), not the combinatorial one, since that
is what is false. Zeeman's conjecture remains open, so it is stated, not attached to a
solver; it belongs here because it is the cleanest target exercising the collapse API.

**Unlocks.** Manolescu's disproof of the triangulation conjecture (no Kirby number); the
Zeeman collapsibility conjecture, `[Kir97, Problem 5.2]`.

## The smoothing-and-triangulation comparison (far horizon)

Relating the smooth, PL, and topological structures is a major undertaking, arguably its own
roadmap. It sits here, after the layers, on purpose: it is the comparison joining layer 1's
chart-based `PLGroupoid` to layer 11's combinatorial manifolds, and most of it should wait
until both of those exist, so no one starts it as early layer-1 work. Stage it, hardest part
last:

1. **Smooth implies PL.** Every smooth manifold has an essentially unique PL structure (a
   smooth triangulation, Whitehead). References: J. H. C. Whitehead, *On C¹-complexes*, Ann.
   of Math. 41 (1940) 809–824; the full modern development in J. Munkres, *Elementary
   Differential Topology* (Annals of Math. Studies 54, 1966), the smoothing-of-triangulations
   and uniqueness sections. Classical and self-contained, but already a substantial body of
   work (Whitney/Cairns triangulation plus the uniqueness argument).
2. **PL implies Top.** The forgetful direction, immediate from layer 1's inclusion
   `PLGroupoid ≤ continuousGroupoid`.
3. **Top to PL, the smoothing obstruction.** The deep, far-horizon part: the
   Kirby–Siebenmann obstruction in `H⁴(M; ℤ/2)` to a PL structure, and the failure of the
   Hauptvermutung. Reference: R. Kirby, L. Siebenmann, *Foundational Essays on Topological
   Manifolds, Smoothings, and Triangulations* (Annals of Math. Studies 88, 1977), Essays
   IV–V. Treat this as genuinely speculative, and keep each direction a separate named target
   so the easy ones are never blocked on the hard one.

## Acceptance criteria (checks along the way)

Concrete checks that rule out vacuous or mis-stated definitions:

- **Gluing computes.** `S³` presented as two solid tori glued along their boundary, and
  `S^n # S^n ≃ S^n` (connected sum with a sphere is trivial): both should be theorems, not
  just definitions, on the layer-1 API.
- **Knot theory is not vacuous.** The Alexander polynomial of the trefoil and the
  figure-eight match their known values (`t − 1 + t⁻¹` and `−t + 3 − t⁻¹`), computed by the
  layer-4 algorithm from a braid word or Seifert matrix; the unknot is smoothly slice; the
  trefoil is not; and a presentation-changing map (a braid closes to a diagram) is checked
  on a small example. The convention table is pinned by these.
- **Surgery recovers known manifolds.** `0`-surgery and `∞`-surgery on the unknot give
  `S¹ × S²` and `S³` respectively; `(p/q)`-surgery on the unknot gives the lens space
  `L(p, q)`. These pin down the layer-5 slope-and-gluing conventions.
- **The diffeomorphism-group topology is non-trivial.** `π₀ Diff(S³)` and the inclusion
  `O(4) → Diff(S³)` are stateable, and the Smale-conjecture target elaborates (layer 3).
- **Volume is an invariant.** The hyperbolic volume of a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold is
  well-defined and isometry-invariant, and the Weeks-manifold target elaborates (layer 7).
- **Realization round-trips.** The geometric realization of the boundary of the standard
  `n`-simplex is homeomorphic to `S^{n-1}` (layer 11), reusing the simplicial-set
  realization where possible.
- **Statements, not vacuities.** Each Kirby target above elaborates against the layer it
  is attached to, with the hypotheses unbundled, and is not provable by `rfl` or
  vacuously true (spot-check by negating a hypothesis and confirming the statement
  changes).

A contributor expanding a layer should still attach the precise theorem reference for each
statement they make (and the relevant Kirby-list successor entry where one exists); the
list above is the entry point, not a substitute.

## How to drive it

Layers 1, 2, and 3 can start immediately and independently against current Mathlib: they
are the high-leverage substrate, and each is reusable library infrastructure on its own.
Layer 1 is the spine almost everything else waits on, so push it first; layers 2 and 3 are
genuinely parallel on-ramps. Layer 4 (knot theory) is a substantial subproject that can
also start immediately and is owned here; layer 5 (Dehn surgery) follows layer 1 and layer
4's knot types, and layer 6 (concordance) follows layer 4. Layers 7 and 8 share a
Riemannian substrate and should be planned together, after the layer-7 volume measure
lands. Layers 9, 10, and 11 are independent of each other and can begin once layer 1's
handlebody and tangent-field API exists. The homological concordance invariants (`τ`, `s`)
are coordinated with the combinatorial Heegaard Floer roadmap, which consumes layer 4's
knot types in return.

## Acknowledgements

This roadmap grew out of walking the Kirby problem list while building the topology
problems in [`leanprover/lean-eval`](https://github.com/leanprover/lean-eval), and out of
the design discussions behind the
[combinatorial Heegaard Floer roadmap](../CombinatorialHeegaardFloer/README.md), whose
knot-theory and concordance lanes it consumes. Thanks to everyone who contributed to those
