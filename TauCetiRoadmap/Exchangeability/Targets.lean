# Exchangeability and de Finetti: target signatures

The narrative roadmap, the library spine, the layer-by-layer build plan (Layers 0–8), the
worked examples, and the references are in `README.md`.

This file holds the **Layer 0** target signatures: the core symmetry notions (sequence
laws, finite and full exchangeability, contractability), the directing-measure object
(`ConditionallyIID`, with `ν : Ω → ProbabilityMeasure α`), path-space data (`pathLaw`,
`prefixProj`, `shift`), finite-dimensional marginal uniqueness (an ℕ-prefix wrapper over
Mathlib's `FiniteDimensionalLaws`), and the easy bridges among the symmetry classes; the
implication lattice and the adjacent-transposition and strictly-increasing-map
characterizations are described in `README.md`. These elaborate
against the pinned Mathlib and are stated with `sorry` (allowed in this human-owned roadmap
library).

Layer 0 needs only Mathlib, not any not-yet-chosen Tau Ceti API. Later layers add their
milestones here as their types become expressible:

* Layer 1 (product kernels, conditional independence, mixtures): consume Mathlib's
  cylinder/π-system facts (`generateFrom_pi`, `generateFrom_squareCylinders`); build the
  random product-kernel measurability and the common ending
  `conditional_iid_from_directing_measure`.
* Layer 2 (process tails and path-space dynamics): `tailFamily`, `tailProcess`, and the
  shift-invariant σ-algebra.
* Layer 3 (L² averaging and the standard-Borel de Finetti route, with the real-valued L²
  convergence theorem as the intermediate analytic step): `deFinetti_viaL2`.
* Layer 4 (reverse martingales and conditional-expectation limits): `condExp_tendsto_iInf`
  for antitone filtrations.
* Layer 5 (Koopman operators and invariant σ-algebras): the positive/unital Markov-operator
  API, multiplicativity for deterministic Koopman operators, and `deFinetti_viaKoopman`.
* Layer 6 (directing measures and the de Finetti representation): the default `deFinetti`,
  `deFinetti_RyllNardzewski_equivalence`, the directing-measure API (a.e. uniqueness, the
  factorization identity), and the empirical-measure and mixture forms.
* Layer 8 (generalized exchangeability and representation theorems): finite de Finetti bounds,
  other countable index types, ergodic decomposition, Markov exchangeability, and
  Aldous–Hoover.

These are roadmap-local target shapes; the implementation in `TauCeti/` may refine names and
namespaces, but the statements below pin the intended early milestones and dependency order.

/-- **Layer 0, finite exchangeability.** Exchangeable means `ExchangeableAt` at every `n`
(not a single-`n` statement). -/
def Exchangeable (μ : Measure Ω) (X : ℕ → Ω → α) : Prop :=

/-- **Layer 0, full exchangeability.** The path law is invariant under all permutations of
`ℕ`. -/

/-- **Layer 0, contractability.** Invariance under strictly increasing finite subsequences.
(Equivalently, invariance under the monoid of strictly increasing maps `ℕ → ℕ`;
`Spreadable` is the standard synonym, with `Contractable` the first formal target.) -/

def pathLaw (μ : Measure Ω) (X : ℕ → Ω → α) : Measure (ℕ → α) :=

def prefixProj (α : Type*) (n : ℕ) (x : ℕ → α) : Fin n → α := fun i => x i.val

/-- **Layer 0, left shift** on path space. -/
def shift (α : Type*) (x : ℕ → α) : ℕ → α := fun n => x (n + 1)

/-- **Layer 0, conditionally i.i.d.** There is a measurable random probability measure
`ν : Ω → ProbabilityMeasure α` so that every finite block of distinct coordinates is
distributed as the `ν`-mixture of the corresponding product measure (the explicit
finite-index factorization; `ProbabilityMeasure.pi` supplies the product). -/

/-- **Layer 0, finite-marginal uniqueness.** Two measures on path space, with `μ` finite,
agreeing on every finite-dimensional prefix marginal are equal (`ν`'s finiteness is forced by
the conclusion). This is a roadmap-local ℕ-prefix wrapper over Mathlib's projective-limit
machinery (`IsProjectiveLimit.unique`), not new measure theory; the `sorry` is the thin
`Fin n`-prefix ↔ finite-subset adapter. Assuming only `[IsFiniteMeasure μ]` covers probability
applications too, via the `IsProbabilityMeasure → IsFiniteMeasure` instance, so no separate
probability wrapper is needed. -/
