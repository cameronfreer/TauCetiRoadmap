# Exchangeability and de Finetti: target signatures

The narrative roadmap, the library spine, the layer-by-layer build plan (Layers 0–7), the
worked examples, and the references are in `README.md`.

This file holds the **Layer 0** target signatures: the core symmetry notions (sequence
laws, finite and full exchangeability, contractability), the directing-measure object
(`ConditionallyIID`, with `ν : Ω → ProbabilityMeasure α`), path-space data (`pathLaw`,
`prefixProj`, `shift`), finite-dimensional marginal uniqueness, and the easy bridges among
the symmetry classes. These elaborate against the pinned Mathlib and are stated with `sorry`
(allowed in this human-owned roadmap library).

Layer 0 needs only Mathlib, not any not-yet-chosen Tau Ceti API. Later layers add their
milestones here as their types become expressible:

* Layer 1 (product kernels, conditional independence, mixtures): product-kernel
  measurability and the common ending `conditional_iid_from_directing_measure`.
* Layer 2 (process tails and path-space dynamics): `tailFamily`, `tailProcess`, and the
  shift-invariant σ-algebra.
* Layer 3 (L² averaging library and real-valued de Finetti): `deFinetti_viaL2`.
* Layer 4 (reverse martingales and conditional-expectation limits): `condExp_tendsto_iInf`
  for antitone filtrations.
* Layer 5 (Koopman operators and invariant σ-algebras): `deFinetti_viaKoopman`.
* Layer 6 (directing measures and the de Finetti representation): the default `deFinetti`
  and `deFinetti_RyllNardzewski_equivalence`.

These are roadmap-local target shapes; the implementation in `TauCeti/` may refine names and
namespaces, but the statements below pin the intended early milestones and dependency order.

distributed as the `ν`-mixture of the corresponding product measure (the explicit
finite-index factorization; `ProbabilityMeasure.pi` supplies the product). -/
